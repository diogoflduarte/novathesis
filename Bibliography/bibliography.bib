	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The cerebellum regulates complex movements and is also implicated in cognitive tasks, and cerebellar dysfunction is consequently associated not only with movement disorders, but also with conditions like autism and dyslexia. How information is encoded by specific cerebellar firing patterns remains debated, however. A central question is how the cerebellar cortex transmits its integrated output to the cerebellar nuclei via GABAergic synapses from Purkinje neurons. Possible answers come from accumulating evidence that subsets of Purkinje cells synchronize their firing during behaviors that require the cerebellum. Consistent with models predicting that coherent activity of inhibitory networks has the capacity to dictate firing patterns of target neurons, recent experimental work supports the idea that inhibitory synchrony may regulate the response of cerebellar nuclear cells to Purkinje inputs, owing to the interplay between unusually fast inhibitory synaptic responses and high rates of intrinsic activity. Data from multiple laboratories lead to a working hypothesis that synchronous inhibitory input from Purkinje cells can set the timing and rate of action potentials produced by cerebellar nuclear cells, thereby relaying information out of the cerebellum. If so, then changing spatiotemporal patterns of Purkinje activity would allow different subsets of inhibitory neurons to control cerebellar output at different times. Here we explore the evidence for and against the idea that a synchrony code defines, at least in part, the input–output function between the cerebellar cortex and nuclei. We consider the literature on the existence of simple spike synchrony, convergence of Purkinje neurons onto nuclear neurons, and intrinsic properties of nuclear neurons that contribute to responses to inhibition. Finally, we discuss factors that may disrupt or modulate a synchrony code and describe the potential contributions of inhibitory synchrony to other motor circuits.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

With extracellular recordings during voluntary locomotion in head-fixed mice, we tested how the rate and coherence of inhibition influence CbN cell firing and well-practiced movements. Firing rates of Purkinje and CbN cells were modulated systematically through the stride cycle ({\textasciitilde}200–300 ms). Optogenetically stimulating ChR2-expressing Purkinje cells with light steps or trains evoked either asynchronous or synchronous inhibition of CbN cells. Steps slowed CbN firing. Trains suppressed CbN cell firing less effectively, but consistently altered millisecond-scale spike timing. Steps or trains that perturbed stride-related modulation of CbN cell firing rates correlated well with irregularities of movement, suggesting that ongoing locomotion is sensitive to alterations in modulated CbN cell firing. Unperturbed locomotion continued more often during trains than steps, however, suggesting that stride-related modulation of CbN spiking is less readily disrupted by synchronous than asynchronous inhibition.},

	abstract = {Pathophysiological, lesion, and electrophysiological studies suggest that the cerebellar cortex is important for controlling the direction and speed of movement. The relationship of cerebellar Purkinje cell discharge to the control of arm movement parameters, however, remains unclear. The goal of this study was to examine how movement direction and speed and their interaction—velocity—modulate Purkinje cell simple spike discharge in an arm movement task in which direction and speed were independently controlled. The simple spike discharge of 154 Purkinje cells was recorded in two monkeys during the performance of two visuomotor tasks that required the animals to track targets that moved in one of eight directions and at one of four speeds. Single-parameter regression analyses revealed that a large proportion of cells had discharge modulation related to movement direction and speed. Most cells with significant directional tuning, however, were modulated at one speed, and most cells with speed-related discharge were modulated along one direction; this suggested that the patterns of simple spike discharge were not adequately described by single-parameter models. Therefore, a regression surface was fitted to the data, which showed that the discharge could be tuned to specific direction–speed combinations (preferred velocities). The overall variability in simple spike discharge was well described by the surface model, and the velocities corresponding to maximal and minimal discharge rates were distributed uniformly throughout the workspace. Simple spike discharge therefore appears to integrate information about both the direction and speed of arm movements, thereby encoding movement velocity.},

During locomotion, cerebellar Purkinje cells are rhythmically active, shaping descending signals and coordinating commands from higher brain areas with the step cycle. However, the variation in this activity across steps has not been studied, and its statistical structure, afferent mechanisms, and relationship to behavior remain unknown. Here, using multi-electrode recordings in freely moving rats, we show that behavioral variables systematically inﬂuence the shape of the step-locked ﬁring rate. This effect depends strongly on the phase of the step cycle and reveals a functional clustering of Purkinje cells. Furthermore, we ﬁnd a pronounced disassociation between patterns of variability driven by the parallel and climbing ﬁbers. These results suggest that Purkinje cell activity not only represents step phase within each cycle but also is shaped by behavior across steps, facilitating control of movement under dynamic conditions.},

	abstract = {1. In the present study, locomotor-correlated activity of cerebellar Purkinje cells, recorded using arrays of microwires chronically implanted in adult female rats, was examined across estrous-cycle-associated fluctuations in endogenous sex steroids. Ongoing studies from this laboratory have shown that systemic and local administration of the sex steroid 17 beta-estradiol (E2) augments excitatory responses of cerebellar Purkinje cells to iontophoretically applied glutamate, recorded in vivo from anesthetized female rats. In addition, this steroid potentiated discharge correlated with limb movement. For the present study, extracellular single-unit activity was recorded from as many as 5-11 Purkinje cells simultaneously during treadmill locomotion paradigms. Motor modulation of activity was recorded across three to five consecutive estrous cycles from behaviorally identified cohorts of neurons to test the hypothesis that fluctuations in endogenous sex steroids alter motor modulation of Purkinje cell discharge. 2. Locomotor-associated discharge correlated with treadmill locomotion was increased by a mean of 47\% on proestrus, when E2 levels are elevated, relative to diestrus 1. These changes in discharge rate during treadmill locomotion were of significantly greater magnitude than corresponding cyclic alterations in discharge during stationary periods. 3. Correlations with the circadian cycle were also significant, because peak levels of locomotor-associated discharge on the night of behavioral estrus, following elevations in circulating E2, were on average 67\% greater than corresponding discharge recorded during the light (proestrus). 4. Alterations in the step cycle were also observed across the estrous cycle: significant decreases in the duration of the flexion phase (by 265 ms, P {\textless} 0.05) were noted on estrus compared with diestrus. 5. When recorded on estrus, Purkinje cell discharge correlated with the stance or flexion phase of the step cycle was greater in magnitude and preceded the event by an average of 130 ms, compared with values determined on diestrus. 6. On estrus, responses of Purkinje neurons to iontophoretically applied quisqualate were enhanced fourfold after administration of exogenous E2, assessed in urethan-anesthetized female rats. 7. In addition, systemic administration of E2 (30 ng iv) potentiated responses of cerebellar Purkinje cells to electrical stimulation of the forepaw by an average of 150\%, recorded in anesthetized female rats. 8. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that elevations in circulating E2 are associated with enhanced discharge of cerebellar Purkinje cells in response to pharmacological or electrical stimuli or associated with locomotor behavior.},

All were studied during periods of steady walking at 0.5 m/s and most were also studied in the resting animal. Most neurones were in nucleus interpositus anterior; forty‐four cells were shown by antidromic invasion to project to the mid‐brain. Most neurones discharged tonically in the absence of overt movements and the mean rate was 42 impulses/s (S.D. +/‐ 23). During locomotion the mean rate was 68 impulses/s (S.D. +/‐ 32). In all but seven neurones the discharge during locomotion was frequency modulated but in different neurones the depth of modulation varied from 5 to 161 impulses/s (mean 52 impulses/s; S.D. +/‐ 30) and the time of peak discharge relative to the step cycle in the ipsilateral forelimb also varied widely. Despite the individual differences the population as a whole was much more active during forelimb swing than during stance, both in numbers of neurones strongly active and in over‐all average discharge rate (74 impulses/s as compared with 55). Most neurones had tactile receptive fields on the ipsilateral forelimb while others received input from head and neck or from both ipsilateral limbs. The tendency to discharge preferentially during early swing was greatest for the first group, especially the subpopulations with receptive fields around or proximal to the elbow. Cells encountered in close sequence during a micro‐electrode track had similarly located receptive fields and usually showed similar patterns of discharge during locomotion. These findings are discussed in relation to the suggestion by Orlovsky (1972a, b, c) that nucleus interpositus assists in regulating locomotion by evoking rubrospinal discharges which facilitate the flexor muscle activities produced by the spinal mechanisms responsible for generating the swing phase of the step cycle.},

Seventy‐six of the cells were also studied whilst the animals sat or lay quietly without movement. Complex spikes were discharged at 1‐2/s and these were accompanied by simple spikes in fifty‐nine cells (78\%); in the remaining cells there were no or few simple spikes. The over‐all mean discharge rate (including both types of spike) was 37.8 +/‐ 27 impulses/s (+/‐ S.D.). During locomotion all cells discharged both types of spike and the over‐all mean rate was 57.6 +/‐ 29 impulses/s (+/‐ S.D.). In all cells but one, the frequency of the simple spikes was modulated rhythmically in time with the stepping movements but the phasing relative to the step cycle varied widely between cells. Peak rates also varied widely, the average being 91.5 +/‐ 44 impulses/s (+/‐ S.D.).

	abstract = {All forms of locomotion are repetitive motor activities that require coordinated bilateral activation of muscles. The executive elements of locomotor control are networks of spinal neurons that determine gait pattern through the sequential activation of motor-neuron pools on either side of the body axis. However, little is known about the constraints that link left-right coordination to locomotor speed. Recent advances have indicated that both excitatory and inhibitory commissural neurons may be involved in left-right coordination. But the neural underpinnings of this, and a possible causal link between these different groups of commissural neurons and left-right alternation, are lacking. Here we show, using intersectional mouse genetics, that ablation of a group of transcriptionally defined commissural neurons–the V0 population–leads to a quadrupedal hopping at all frequencies of locomotion. The selective ablation of inhibitory V0 neurons leads to a lack of left-right pattern at low frequencies, mixed coordination at medium frequencies, and alternation at high locomotor frequencies. When ablation is targeted to excitatory V0 neurons, left-right alternation is present at low frequencies, and hopping is restricted to medium and high locomotor frequencies. Therefore, the intrinsic logic of the central control of locomotion incorporates a modular organization, with two subgroups of V0 neurons required for the existence of left-right alternating modes at different speeds of locomotion. The two molecularly distinct sets of commissural neurons may constrain species-related naturally occurring frequency-dependent coordination and be involved in the evolution of different gaits.},

To reexamine this notion in this review, I analyzed structures of motor control systems involving the cerebellum. A dichotomy was found between the two types of error: sensory and motor errors play roles in the feedforward and feedback control conditions, respectively. To substantiate this dichotomy, here in this article I reviewed recent data on neuronal connections and signal contents of climbing fibers in the vestibuloocular reflex ({VOR}), optokinetic eye movement response, saccade, hand reaching, cursor tracking, as well as some other cases of motor control. In our studies, various sources of sensory and motor errors were located in the neuronal pathways leading to the inferior olive. We noted that during the course of evolution, control system structures involving the cerebellum changed rather radically from the prototype seen in the flocculonodular lobe and vermis to that applicable to the cerebellar hemisphere. Nevertheless, the dichotomy between sensory and motor errors is maintained.},

	abstract = {Under natural conditions and in some experimental models, rabies virus infection of the central nervous system causes relatively mild histopathological changes, without prominent evidence of neuronal death despite its lethality. In this study, the effects of rabies virus infection on the structure of neurons were investigated with experimentally infected transgenic mice expressing yellow fluorescent protein ({YFP}) in neuronal subpopulations. Six-week-old mice were inoculated in the hind-limb footpad with the {CVS} strain of fixed virus or were mock infected with vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline). Brain regions were subsequently examined by light, epifluorescent, and electron microscopy. In moribund {CVS}-infected mice, histopathological changes were minimal in paraffin-embedded tissue sections, although mild inflammatory changes were present. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated {dUTP}-biotin nick end labeling and caspase-3 immunostaining showed only a few apoptotic cells in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Silver staining demonstrated the preservation of cytoskeletal integrity in the cerebral cortex. However, fluorescence microscopy revealed marked beading and fragmentation of the dendrites and axons of layer V pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex, cerebellar mossy fibers, and axons in brainstem tracts. At an earlier time point, when mice displayed hind-limb paralysis, beading was observed in a few axons in the cerebellar commissure. Toluidine blue-stained resin-embedded sections from moribund {YFP}-expressing animals revealed vacuoles within the perikarya and proximal dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These vacuoles corresponded with swollen mitochondria under electron microscopy. Vacuolation was also observed ultrastructurally in axons and in presynaptic nerve endings. We conclude that the observed structural changes are sufficient to explain the severe clinical disease with a fatal outcome in this experimental model of rabies.},

Computationally, internal models can be characterized by 2 extreme representations: structured and tabular (C. G. Atkeson, 1989). Tabular models do not need prior knowledge about the structure of the motor apparatus, but they lack the capability to generalize learned movements. Structured models, on the other hand, can generalize learned movements, but they require an analytical description of the motor apparatus. In investigating humans' capacity to generalize kinematic transformations, we examined which type of representation humans' motor system might use. Results suggest that internal representations are nonstructured and nontabular. Findings may be due to a neural network model with a medium number of neurons and synapses.},

	abstract = {A fundamental question in neurobiology is how animals integrate external sensory information from their environment with self-generated motor and sensory signals in order to guide motor behavior and adaptation. The cerebellum is a vertebrate hindbrain region where all of these signals converge and that has been implicated in the acquisition, coordination, and calibration of motor activity. Theories of cerebellar function postulate that granule cells encode a variety of sensorimotor signals in the cerebellar input layer. These models suggest that representations should be high-dimensional, sparse, and temporally patterned. However, in vivo physiological recordings addressing these points have been limited and in particular have been unable to measure the spatiotemporal dynamics of population-wide activity. In this study, we use both calcium imaging and electrophysiology in the awake larval zebrafish to investigate how cerebellar granule cells encode three types of sensory stimuli as well as stimulus-evoked motor behaviors. We find that a large fraction of all granule cells are active in response to these stimuli, such that representations are not sparse at the population level. We find instead that most responses belong to only one of a small number of distinct activity profiles, which are temporally homogeneous and anatomically clustered. We furthermore identify granule cells that are active during swimming behaviors and others that are multimodal for sensory and motor variables. When we pharmacologically change the threshold of a stimulus-evoked behavior, we observe correlated changes in these representations. Finally, electrophysiological data show no evidence for temporal patterning in the coding of different stimulus durations.},

	abstract = {Background Motion correction is a challenging pre-processing problem that arises early in the analysis pipeline of calcium imaging data sequences. The motion artifacts in two-photon microscopy recordings can be non-rigid, arising from the finite time of raster scanning and non-uniform deformations of the brain medium. New method We introduce an algorithm for fast Non-Rigid Motion Correction ({NoRMCorre}) based on template matching. {NoRMCorre} operates by splitting the field of view ({FOV}) into overlapping spatial patches along all directions. The patches are registered at a sub-pixel resolution for rigid translation against a regularly updated template. The estimated alignments are subsequently up-sampled to create a smooth motion field for each frame that can efficiently approximate non-rigid artifacts in a piecewise-rigid manner. Existing methods Existing approaches either do not scale well in terms of computational performance or are targeted to non-rigid artifacts arising just from the finite speed of raster scanning, and thus cannot correct for non-rigid motion observable in datasets from a large {FOV}. Results {NoRMCorre} can be run in an online mode resulting in comparable to or even faster than real time motion registration of streaming data. We evaluate its performance with simple yet intuitive metrics and compare against other non-rigid registration methods on simulated data and in vivo two-photon calcium imaging datasets. Open source Matlab and Python code is also made available. Conclusions The proposed method and accompanying code can be useful for solving large scale image registration problems in calcium imaging, especially in the presence of non-rigid deformations.},

Using automated homecage training and a novel forelimb sensor, we trained freely-moving mice to initiate forelimb sequences with clearly resolved submillimeter-scale micromovements followed by millimeter-scale reaches to learned spatial targets. Hundreds of thousands of trajectories were decomposed into millions of kinematic primitives, while closed-loop photoinhibition was used to test roles of motor cortical areas. Inactivation of contralateral motor cortex reduced primitive peak speed but, surprisingly, did not substantially affect primitive direction, initiation, termination, or complexity, resulting in isomorphic, spatially contracted trajectories that undershot targets. Our findings demonstrate separable loss of a single kinematic parameter, speed, and identify conditions where loss of cortical drive reduces the gain of motor primitives but does not affect their generation, timing or direction. The combination of high precision forelimb sensing with automated training and neural manipulation provides a system for studying how motor sequences are constructed from elemental building blocks.},

	abstract = {Commissural axons in vertebrates and insects are initially attracted to the nervous system midline, but once they reach this intermediate target they undergo a dramatic switch, becoming responsive to repellent Slit proteins at the midline, which expel them onto the next leg of their trajectory. We have unexpectedly implicated a divergent member of the Robo family, Rig-1 (or Robo3), in preventing premature Slit sensitivity in mammals. Expression of Rig-1 protein by commissural axons is inversely correlated with Slit sensitivity. Removal of Rig-1 results in a total failure of commissural axons to cross. Genetic and in vitro analyses indicate that Rig-1 functions to repress Slit responsiveness similarly to Commissureless (Comm) in Drosophila. Unlike Comm, however, Rig-1 does not produce its effect by downregulating Robo receptors on precrossing commissural axon membranes. These results identify a mechanism for regulating Slit repulsion that helps choreograph the precise switch from attraction to repulsion at a key intermediate axonal target.},

	abstract = {The brain of gastropod mollusks contains many giant neurons with polyploid genomic {DNAs}. Such {DNAs} are generated through repeated {DNA} endoreplication during body growth. However, it is not known what triggers {DNA} endoreplication in neurons. There are two possibilities: (1) {DNAs} are replicated in response to some unknown molecules in the hemolymph that reflect the nutritive status of the animal; or (2) {DNAs} are replicated in response to some unknown factors that are retrogradely transported through axons from the innervated target organs. We first tested whether hemolymph with rich nutrition could induce {DNA} endoreplication. We tested whether the transplanted brain exhibits enhanced {DNA} endoreplication like an endogenous brain does when transplanted into the homocoel of the body of a slug whose body growth is promoted by an increased food supply. However, no enhancement was observed in the frequency of {DNA} endoreplication when we compared the transplanted brains in the growth-promoted and growth-suppressed host slugs, suggesting that the humoral environment is irrelevant to triggering the body growth-dependent {DNA} endoreplication. Next, we tested the requirement of target innervation by surgically dissecting a unilateral posterior pedal nerve of an endogenous brain. Substantially lower number of neurons exhibited {DNA} endoreplication in the pedal ganglion ipsilateral to the dissected nerve. These results support the view that enhanced {DNA} endoreplication is mediated by target innervation and is not brought about through the direct effect of humoral factors in the hemolymph during body growth. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Correct function of neural circuits depends on highly organized neuronal connections, refined from less precise projections through synaptic elimination, collateral regression, or neuronal death. We examined regressive phenomena that define olivocerebellar topography during maturation from Purkinje cell polyinnervation to monoinnervation. We used bilateral retrograde tracing to determine the source of olivocerebellar afferents to posterior vermis lobules {VII}-{VIII} in a model of retained immature Purkinje cell polyinnervation, the granuloprival cerebellum. In controls, labelled neurons were found only in the contralateral inferior olive ({ION}) clustered in a small ventromedial locus that is congruent with known olivocerebellar topography. In granuloprival animals, olivary labelling appeared more dispersed and was present in homologous ipsilateral regions. Double-labelled neurons were never seen. Retrograde tracing following unilateral olivocerebellar transection in adult granuloprival rats revealed: 1) the origin of the normal (remaining) path projecting through the contralateral inferior peduncle was more localized than in irradiated nonpedunculotomized rats, 2) a small double-crossed path, and 3) a projection that ascends the peduncle ipsilateral to the {ION} of origin, part of which crosses the midline within the cerebellum. Electrophysiological and immunohistochemical assessment in the neonatal cerebellum revealed that transcommissural paths are not present during development but sprout within the irradiated cerebellum. Therefore, the olivocerebellar projection in the granuloprival rat, as a model of the immature path, shows parasagittal organization similar to that of controls in its normally crossed path but possesses additional abnormal projections. Thus, maturation of olivocerebellar topography involves removal of whole developmental paths to define laterality plus synapse elimination within largely predefined parasagittal zones.},

One class of spinal interneurons implicated in the control of mammalian forelimb movement, cervical propriospinal neurons ({PNs}), has the potential to convey an internal copy of premotor signals through dual innervation of forelimb-innervating motor neurons and precerebellar neurons of the lateral reticular nucleus. Here we examine whether the {PN} internal copy pathway functions in the control of goal-directed reaching. In mice, {PNs} include a genetically accessible subpopulation of cervical V2a interneurons, and their targeted ablation perturbs reaching while leaving intact other elements of forelimb movement. Moreover, optogenetic activation of the {PN} internal copy branch recruits a rapid cerebellar feedback loop that modulates forelimb motor neuron activity and severely disrupts reaching kinematics. Our findings implicate V2a {PNs} as the focus of an internal copy pathway assigned to the rapid updating of motor output during reaching behaviour.},

All neurons in which recombination occurred originated during embryogenesis from the rhombic lip. This might be explained by a very early specification event at the rhombic lip that primes cells derived from this structure to express the transgene during neuronal maturation. As no recombination occurred in the inferior olive, it may be derived from a distinct subset of precursors at the rhombic lip. No recombination occurred in any of the interneurons in the cerebellum (stellate cells, basket cells, and Golgi cells), consistent with the hypothesis that they are not derived from the same embryonic tissue as the granule cells.},

This motor adaptation is thought to depend on the ability to form a memory of a systematic perturbation, often called an internal model. However, the mechanisms underlying the formation, storage, and expression of such models remain unknown. Here, we developed a mouse model to study forelimb adaptation to force field perturbations. We found that temporally precise photoinhibition of somatosensory cortex (S1) applied concurrently with the force field abolished the ability to update subsequent motor commands needed to reduce motor errors. This S1 photoinhibition did not impair basic motor patterns, post-perturbation completion of the action, or their performance in a reward-based learning task. Moreover, S1 photoinhibition after partial adaptation blocked further adaptation, but did not affect the expression of already-adapted motor commands. Thus, S1 is critically involved in updating the memory about the perturbation that is essential for forelimb motor adaptation.},

	abstract = {the growth and length regulation of the flagellar filament of Salmonella Typhimurium. The earlier work by Turner et al. [13] reporting that E. coli filaments grew at constant rates of 13 nm/min was based on filament regrowth after shearing. In hindsight, this can be explained by the Renault et al. [16] injection-diffusion model, since Turner's measurements were extension rates at the ends of broken, long flagella and did not measure initial growth rates of nascent filaments, which the Renault study was able to achieve. The chain model proposed by Evans et al. [14] to explain filament elongation by a constant rate was based on interactions between amino-and carboxy-terminal regions in {FlgE} (hook) and {FliC} filament protein subunits through cysteine crosslinking experiments. However, it is known that the amino-and carboxy-termini of {FlgE} and {FliC} subunits are directly aligned in an anti-parallel orientation in the final folded conformation in the hook and filament, respectively [19,20]. Evans et al. [14] failed to demonstrate a parallel orientation of the amino-and carboxy-terminal helices as predicted by the chain model. They also argued that the 8 {\textbackslash}{AA} cysteine–cysteine spacing could not form between subunits in the assembled hook without testing this possibility. Given the dynamics of hook and filament subunit interactions in structures rotating at speeds of 300 to 1,000 revolutions per second, it would be difficult to assume that a static crystal structure model of hook and filament can accurately represent the dynamic subunit interactions in vivo. {REFERENCES} 1.

We formulate a generative model of the fluorescence image, incorporating spike times and a spatially smooth neuropil signal, and solve the inference and learning problems using a fast algorithm. This implementation scales linearly with the number of recorded cells, and the complete pipeline runs in approximately one hour for typical two-hour long recordings, on commodity {GPUs}. Furthermore, this method recovers twice as many cells as a previous standard method. This allowed us to routinely record and detect ∼10,000 cells simultaneously from the visual cortex of awake mice using standard two-photon resonant-scanning microscopes.

We characterised the activity of putative cerebellar Purkinje cells, Golgi cells and mossy fibres in awake mice engaged in an active locomotion task, using high-density silicon electrode arrays. Analysis of the activity of over 300 neurons in response to locomotion revealed that the majority of cells (53\%) were significantly modulated by phase of the stepping cycle. However, in contrast to studies involving passive locomotion on a treadmill, we found that a high proportion of cells (45\%) were tuned to the speed of locomotion, and 19\% were tuned to yaw movements. The activity of neurons in the cerebellar vermis provided more information about future speed of locomotion than about past or present speed, suggesting a motor, rather than purely sensory, role. We were able to accurately decode the speed of locomotion with a simple linear algorithm, with only a relatively small number of well-chosen cells needed, irrespective of cell class. Our observations suggest that behavioural state modulates cerebellar sensorimotor integration, and advocate a role for the cerebellar vermis in control of high-level locomotor kinematic parameters such as speed and yaw.},

	abstract = {The prevailing model of cerebellar learning states that climbing fibers ({CFs}) are both driven by, and serve to correct, erroneous motor output. However, this model is grounded largely in studies of behaviors that utilize hardwired neural pathways to link sensory input to motor output. To test whether this model applies to more flexible learning regimes that require arbitrary sensorimotor associations, we developed a cerebellar-dependent motor learning task that is compatible with both mesoscale and single-dendrite-resolution calcium imaging in mice. We found that {CFs} were preferentially driven by and more time-locked to correctly executed movements and other task parameters that predict reward outcome, exhibiting widespread correlated activity in parasagittal processing zones that was governed by these predictions. Together, our data suggest that such {CF} activity patterns are well-suited to drive learning by providing predictive instructional input that is consistent with an unsigned reinforcement learning signal but does not rely exclusively on motor errors.},

Yet, its internal micro-circuitry is anatomically, biochemically, and functionally complex. The most striking feature of cerebellar circuit complexity is its compartmentalized topography. Each cell type within the cerebellar cortex is organized into an exquisite map; molecular expression patterns, dendrite projections, and axon terminal fields divide the medial-lateral axis of the cerebellum into topographic sagittal zones. Here, we discuss the mechanisms that establish zones and highlight how gene expression and neural activity contribute to cerebellar pattern formation. We focus on the olivocerebellar system because its developmental mechanisms are becoming clear, its topographic termination patterns are very precise, and its contribution to zonal function is debated. This review deconstructs the architecture and development of the olivocerebellar pathway to provide an update on how brain circuit maps form and function.},

In this particular task, an explicit strategy to reduce motor effort requires a distinct deviation from the nominal rectilinear hand trajectory. Rather, our results display a clear directional preference during learning, as subjects adapted perturbed curved trajectories towards their initial baselines. We model this behavior using the framework of stochastic optimal control theory and an objective function that trades off the discordant requirements of 1) target accuracy, 2) motor effort, and 3) kinematic invariance. Our work addresses the underlying objective of a reaching movement, and we suggest that robustness, particularly against internal model uncertainly, is as essential to the reaching task as terminal accuracy and energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {The ability to silence the activity of genetically specified neurons in a temporally precise fashion would provide the opportunity to investigate the causal role of specific cell classes in neural computations, behaviours and pathologies. Here we show that members of the class of light-driven outward proton pumps can mediate powerful, safe, multiple-colour silencing of neural activity. The gene archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense enables near-100\% silencing of neurons in the awake brain when virally expressed in the mouse cortex and illuminated with yellow light. Arch mediates currents of several hundred picoamps at low light powers, and supports neural silencing currents approaching 900 {pA} at light powers easily achievable in vivo. Furthermore, Arch spontaneously recovers from light-dependent inactivation, unlike light-driven chloride pumps that enter long-lasting inactive states in response to light. These properties of Arch are appropriate to mediate the optical silencing of significant brain volumes over behaviourally relevant timescales. Arch function in neurons is well tolerated because {pH} excursions created by Arch illumination are minimized by self-limiting mechanisms to levels comparable to those mediated by channelrhodopsins or natural spike firing. To highlight how proton pump ecological and genomic diversity may support new innovation, we show that the blue-green light-drivable proton pump from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans (Mac) can, when expressed in neurons, enable neural silencing by blue light, thus enabling alongside other developed reagents the potential for independent silencing of two neural populations by blue versus red light. Light-driven proton pumps thus represent a high-performance and extremely versatile class of 'optogenetic' voltage and ion modulator, which will broadly enable new neuroscientific, biological, neurological and psychiatric investigations.},

For behavioral analysis, {CAVE} can automatically track animal position and orientation. Individual behavioral epochs and external events can then be analyzed in correlation to calcium imaging and tracking data. Our program is written in Matlab, the source code is open source and particularly focuses on providing a streamlined workflow for novice users while also retaining detailed configuration options for advanced users. We evaluate the performance of {CAVE} by investigating neural activity in hippocampus and somatosensory cortex. The fast analysis provided by {CAVE} allowed us to track activity in a large set of animals over the course of several months during exploration behavior, detailing the properties of onset and offset of observable activity and the visible cells per imaging location.},

In the present experiment, three tasks, two requiring simultaneous operation of two manipulanda, the third requiring a differential response with each hand according to the surface texture of a lever on each side of the apparatus, were used to assess the effect in the monkey of combined callosal and cerebellar division in the absence of vision. Although the predominant finding was that there was no substantial impairment on any of the three tasks, certain of the animals were transiently impaired on the first two tasks. The significance of this finding is discussed in relation to alternative anatomical pathways which could mediate the learned performance in the absence of midline callosal and cerebellar fiber tracts. ?? 1976.},

	abstract = {Human motor behavior is constantly adapted through the process of error-based learning. When the motor system encounters an error, its estimate about the body and environment will change, and the next movement will be immediately modified to counteract the underlying perturbation. Here, we show that a second mechanism, use-dependent learning, simultaneously changes movements to become more similar to the last movement. In three experiments, participants made reaching movements toward a horizontally elongated target, such that errors in the initial movement direction did not have to be corrected. Along this task-redundant dimension, we were able to induce use-dependent learning by passively guiding movements in a direction angled by 8° from the previous direction. In a second study, we show that error-based and use-dependent learning can change motor behavior simultaneously in opposing directions by physically constraining the direction of active movements. After removal of the constraint, participants briefly exhibit an error-based aftereffect against the direction of the constraint, followed by a longer-lasting use-dependent aftereffect in the direction of the constraint. In the third experiment, we show that these two learning mechanisms together determine the solution the motor system adopts when learning a motor task.},

	abstract = {Many forms of learning require temporally ordered stimuli. In Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning, a conditioned stimulus ({CS}) must precede the unconditioned stimulus ({US}) by at least about 100 ms for learning to occur. Conditioned responses are learned and generated by the cerebellum. Recordings from the cerebellar cortex during conditioning have revealed {CS}-triggered pauses in the firing of Purkinje cells that likely drive the conditioned blinks. The predominant view of the learning mechanism in conditioning is that long-term depres-sion ({LTD}) at parallel fiber ({PF})–Purkinje cell synapses underlies the Purkinje cell pauses. This raises a serious conceptual challenge because {LTD} is most effectively induced at short {CS}–{US} intervals, which do not support acquisition of eyeblinks. To resolve this discrep-ancy, we recorded Purkinje cells during conditioning with short or long {CS}–{US} intervals. Decerebrated ferrets trained with {CS}–{US} intervals Ն150 ms reliably developed Purkinje cell pauses, but training with an interval of 50 ms unexpectedly induced increases in {CS}-evoked spiking. This bidirectional modulation of Purkinje cell activity offers a basis for the requirement of a minimum {CS}–{US} interval for conditioning, but we argue that it cannot be fully explained by {LTD}, even when previous in vitro studies of stimulus-timing-dependent {LTD} are taken into account.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.02.020},
	abstract = {A major question in the study of cerebellar cortical function is how parallel fiber and climbing fiber inputs interact to shape information processing. Emphasis has been placed on the long-term effects due to conjunctive stimulation of climbing fibers and parallel fibers. Much less emphasis has been placed on short-term interactions and their spatial nature. To address this question the responses to parallel fiber and climbing fiber inputs and their short-term interaction were characterized using optical imaging with Neutral Red in the anesthetized mouse in vivo. Electrical stimulation of the cerebellar surface evoked an increase in fluorescence consisting of a transverse optical beam. The linear relationship between the optical responses and stimulus parameters, high spatial resolution and close coupling to the electrophysiological recordings show the utility of this imaging methodology. The majority of the optical response was due to activation of postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate ({AMPA}) and metabotropic glutamate receptors with a minor contribution from the presynaptic parallel fibers. Stimulation of the inferior olive evoked parasagittal bands that were abolished by blocking {AMPA} glutamate receptors. Conjunctive stimulation of the cerebellar surface and inferior olive resulted in inhibition of the climbing fiber evoked optical responses. This lateral inhibition of the parasagittal bands extended out from both sides of an activated parallel fiber beam and was mediated by {GABAAbut} not {GABABreceptors}. One hypothesized role for lateral inhibition of this type is to spatially focus the interactions between parallel fiber and climbing fiber input on Purkinje cells. In summary optical imaging with Neutral Red permitted visualization of cerebellar cortical responses to parallel fiber and climbing fiber activation. The {GABAAdependent} lateral inhibition of the climbing fiber evoked parasagittal bands by parallel fiber stimulation shows that cerebellar interneurons play a short-term role in shaping the responses of Purkinje cells to climbing fiber input. © 2004 {IBRO}.

We tested this hypothesis in two reaching experiments during which opposing velocity-dependent force fields were randomly applied. We found that within-movement feedback corrections gradually improved, despite the fact that the perturbations were unexpected. Moreover, when participants were instructed to stop at a via-point, the application of a force field prior to the via-point induced mirror-image after-effects after the via-point, indicative of within-trial adaptation to the unexpected dynamics.

	abstract = {In order to control voluntary movements, the central nervous system ({CNS}) must solve the following three computational problems at different levels: the determination of a desired trajectory in the visual coordinates, the transformation of its coordinates to the body coordinates and the generation of motor command. Based on physiological knowledge and previous models, we propose a hierarchical neural network model which accounts for the generation of motor command. In our model the association cortex provides the motor cortex with the desired trajectory in the body coordinates, where the motor command is then calculated by means of long-loop sensory feedback. Within the spinocerebellum–magnocellular red nucleus system, an internal neural model of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system is acquired with practice, because of the heterosynaptic plasticity, while monitoring the motor command and the results of movement. Internal feedback control with this dynamical model updates the motor command by predicting a possible error of movement. Within the cerebrocerebellum–parvocellular red nucleus system, an internal neural model of the inverse-dynamics of the musculo-skeletal system is acquired while monitoring the desired trajectory and the motor command. The inverse-dynamics model substitutes for other brain regions in the complex computation of the motor command. The dynamics and the inverse-dynamics models are realized by a parallel distributed neural network, which comprises many sub-systems computing various nonlinear transformations of input signals and a neuron with heterosynaptic plasticity (that is, changes of synaptic weights are assumed proportional to a product of two kinds of synaptic inputs). Control and learning performance of the model was investigated by computer simulation, in which a robotic manipulator was used as a controlled system, with the following results: (1) Both the dynamics and the inverse-dynamics models were acquired during control of movements. (2) As motor learning proceeded, the inverse-dynamics model gradually took the place of external feedback as the main controller. Concomitantly, overall control performance became much better. (3) Once the neural network model learned to control some movement, it could control quite different and faster movements. (4) The neural network model worked well even when only very limited information about the fundamental dynamical structure of the controlled system was available.},

Our analysis yielded simultaneous Ca(2+) activity traces for up to {\textbackslash}textgreater100 Purkinje cells and Bergmann glia from single recordings. Using this approach, we found microzones of Purkinje cells that were stable across behavioral states and in which synchronous Ca(2+) spiking rose significantly during locomotion.},

Purkinje cells produce two different types of spikes, complex spikes and simple spikes, which often show reciprocal activity:a periodical increase in complex spikes is associated with a decrease in simple spikes, and vice versa. This reciprocal firing is thought to be essential for coordinated motor behavior, yet how it is accomplished is debated. Here, we show in Ptf1a::cre;Robo3lox/lox mice that selectively rerouting the climbing fibers from a contralateral to an ipsilateral projection reversed the complex-spike modulation during sensory stimulation. Strikingly, modulation of simple spikes, which is supposed to be controlled by mossy fibers, reversed as well. Climbing fibers enforce this reciprocity in part by influencing activity of inhibitory interneurons, because the phase of their activity was also converted. Ptf1a::cre;Robo3lox/lox mice showed severe ataxia highlighting that climbing fiber input and its impact on reciprocity of Purkinje cell firing play an important role in motor coordination},

Mutant mice with cerebellar circuit defects exhibit characteristic impairments in locomotor coordination; however, the fundamental features of this gait ataxia have not been effectively isolated. Here we describe a novel system ({LocoMouse}) for analyzing limb, head, and tail kinematics of freely walking mice. Analysis of visibly ataxic Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mice reveals that while differences in the forward motion of individual paws are fully accounted for by changes in walking speed and body size, more complex 3D trajectories and, especially, inter-limb and whole-body coordination are specifically impaired. Moreover, the coordination deficits in pcd are consistent with a failure to predict and compensate for the consequences of movement across the body. These results isolate specific impairments in whole-body coordination in mice and provide a quantitative framework for understanding cerebellar contributions to coordinated locomotion.},

During their tangential migration, neurons of all major hindbrain precerebellar nuclei express high levels of Rig-1 {mRNA}. Rig-1 expression is rapidly downregulated as their leading process crosses the floor plate. Interestingly, most precerebellar nuclei do not develop normally in Rig-1-deficient mice, as they fail to cross the midline. In addition, inferior olivary neurons, which normally send axons into the contralateral cerebellum, project ipsilaterally in Rig-1 mutant mice. Similarly, neurons of the lateral reticular nucleus and basilar pons are unable to migrate across the floor plate and instead remain ipsilateral. These results demonstrate that Rig-1 controls the ability of both precerebellar neuron cell bodies and their axons to cross the midline.},

If the object is unfamiliar to us, our first movement will exhibit an error, producing a trajectory that is different from the one we had intended. This experience of error initiates learning in our brain, making it so that on the very next attempt our motor commands partially compensate for the unfamiliar physics, resulting in smaller errors. With further practice, the compensation becomes more complete, and our brain forms a model that predicts the physics of the object. This model is a motor memory that frees us from having to relearn the physics the next time that we encounter the object. The mechanism by which the brain transforms sensory prediction errors into corrective motor commands is the basis for how we learn the physics of objects with which we interact. The cerebellum and the motor cortex appear to be critical for our ability to learn physics, allowing us to use tools that extend our capabilities, making us masters of our environment.},

This simultaneous calcium imaging of populations of Purkinje cells reveals a striking spatial organization of pauses in Purkinje cell activity between neighboring cells. The source of this organization is shown to be the presynaptic gamma-Aminobutyric acid producing ({GABAergic}) network, and blocking ionotropic gamma-Aminobutyric acid receptor ({GABAARs}) abolishes the synchrony. These data suggest that presynaptic interneurons synchronize (in)activity between neighboring Purkinje cells, and thereby maximize their effect on downstream targets in the deep cerebellar nuclei.},

We found that temporally precise photoinhibition of somatosensory cortex (S1) applied concurrently with the force field abolished the ability to update subsequent motor commands needed to reduce motor errors. This S1 photoinhibition did not impair basic motor patterns, post-perturbation completion of the action, or their performance in a reward-based learning task. Moreover, S1 photoinhibition after partial adaptation blocked further adaptation, but did not affect the expression of already-adapted motor commands. Thus, S1 is critically involved in updating the memory about the perturbation that is essential for forelimb motor adaptation.},

Subjects performed cursor movements either overtly using arm movements, or covertly via a brain-machine interface that moves the cursor based on motor cortical activity (in lieu of arm movement). These tasks helped evaluate whether and how cortical changes resulting from “covert rehearsal” affect overt performance. We found that covert learning indeed transfers to overt performance and is accompanied by systematic population-level changes in motor preparatory activity. Current models of motor cortical function ascribe motor preparation to achieving initial conditions favorable for subsequent movement-period neural dynamics. We found that covert and overt contexts share these initial conditions, and covert rehearsal manipulates them in a manner that persists across context changes, thus facilitating overt motor learning. This transfer learning mechanism might provide new insights into other covert processes like mental rehearsal. Vyas et al. ask whether learning “covertly,” without physical movements, can transfer to overt behavior. By using visuomotor perturbations, they show that covert and overt movements derive from a common neural substrate consisting of motor cortical preparatory activity that facilitates transfer of learning.},

	abstract = {Activity in motor cortex predicts specific movements seconds before they occur, but how this preparatory activity relates to upcoming movements is obscure. We dissected the conversion of preparatory activity to movement within a structured motor cortex circuit. An anterior lateral region of the mouse cortex (a possible homologue of premotor cortex in primates) contains equal proportions of intermingled neurons predicting ipsi-or contralateral movements, yet unilateral inactivation of this cortical region during movement planning disrupts contralateral movements. Using cell-type-specific electrophysiology, cellular imaging and optogenetic perturbation, we show that layer 5 neurons projecting within the cortex have unbiased laterality. Activity with a contralateral population bias arises specifically in layer 5 neurons projecting to the brainstem, and only late during movement planning. These results reveal the transformation of distributed preparatory activity into movement commands within hierarchically organized cortical circuits. The motor cortex is critical for planning and the execution of volun-tary movements 1 . Unilateral lesions in premotor areas of motor cortex disrupt planning of movements into the contra-lesional space 2–4 . Neu-rons in premotor cortex have activity anticipating specific movements long before movement onset 1,5–8 , a neural correlate of movement plan-ning 1 . But intermingled motor cortex neurons show puzzlingly diverse selectivity 9,10 for multiple movement directions with complex dynamics 4,11,12 . The relationship of this complex preparatory activity to future movements is not understood. A key question is how preparatory activity evolves into commands that descend to motor centres to trigger movement. In the mouse, the anterior lateral motor cortex ({ALM}) is involved in planning directed licking 13 . Unilateral inactivation of {ALM} during move-ment planning interferes with upcoming tongue movements in the con-tralateral direction without impairing movements 13 . A large proportion of {ALM} neurons exhibit preparatory activity that predicts movements 13 , similar to premotor cortex in non-human primates 1,7,8,11,14 . Despite the lateralized deficit from {ALM} inactivation, {ALM} neurons in each hemi-sphere have a preference for contra-or ipsilateral movements in roughly equal proportions 13 . To determine how silencing a brain area with non-lateralized selec-tivity causes a directional movement bias we measured neuronal activity within hierarchically organized {ALM} circuits. {ALM} projection neurons include two major classes: intratelencephalic neurons that project to other cortical areas and pyramidal tract neurons that project out of the cortex, including to motor-related areas in the brainstem 15,16},

Focal lesions were manually traced on magnetic resonance images and normalized using a new spatially unbiased template of the cerebellum. In addition, we reanalyzed data from 14 patients with cerebellar degeneration using voxel-based morphometry. We found that adjacent regions with only little overlap in the anterior arm area (lobules {IV} to {VI}) are important for adaptation in both tasks. Although adaptation to the force field task lay more anteriorly (lobules {IV} and V), lobule {VI} was more important for the visuomotor task. In addition, regions in the posterolateral cerebellum (Crus I and {II}) contributed to both tasks. No consistent involvement of the posterior arm region (lobule {VIII}) was found. Independence of the two kinds of adaptation is further supported by findings that performance in one task did not correlate to performance in the other task. Our results show that the anterior arm area of the cerebellum is functionally divided into a more posterior part of lobule {VI}, extending into lobule V, related to visuomotor adaption, and a more anterior part including lobules {IV} and V, related to force field adaption.

However, unlike for electrophysiological signals, standardized algorithms for assigning optically recorded signals to individual cells have not yet emerged. Here, we describe an automated sorting procedure that combines independent component analysis and image segmentation for extracting cells' locations and their dynamics with minimal human supervision. In validation studies using simulated data, automated sorting significantly improved estimation of cellular signals compared to conventional analysis based on image regions of interest. We used automated procedures to analyze data recorded by two-photon Ca(2+) imaging in the cerebellar vermis of awake behaving mice. Our analysis yielded simultaneous Ca(2+) activity traces for up to {\textbackslash}textgreater100 Purkinje cells and Bergmann glia from single recordings. Using this approach, we found microzones of Purkinje cells that were stable across behavioral states and in which synchronous Ca(2+) spiking rose significantly during locomotion.},

	title = {Learning of Visuomotor Transformations for Vectorial Planning of Reaching Trajectories},
	url = {http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/20/23/8916.full.pdf},
	abstract = {The planning of visually guided reaches is accomplished by independent specification of extent and direction. We investigated whether this separation of extent and direction planning for well practiced movements could be explained by differences in the adaptation to extent and directional errors during motor learning. We compared the time course and generalization of adaptation with two types of screen cursor transformation that altered the relationship between hand space and screen space. The first was a gain change that induced extent errors and required subjects to learn a new scaling factor. The second was a screen cursor rotation that induced directional errors and required subjects to learn new reference axes. Subjects learned a new scaling factor at the same rate when training with one or multiple target distances, whereas learning new reference axes took longer and was less complete when training with multiple compared with one target direction. After training to a single target, subjects were able to transfer learning of a new scaling factor to previously unvisited distances and directions. In contrast , generalization of rotation adaptation was incomplete; there was transfer across distances and arm configurations but not across directions. Learning a rotated reference frame only occurred after multiple target directions were sampled during training. These results suggest the separate processing of extent and directional errors by the brain and support the idea that reaching movements are planned as a hand-centered vector whose extent and direction are established via learning a scaling factor and reference axes. In planning reaches to visual targets the nervous system transforms information about target location into time-varying sets of muscle activations and joint torques that bring the hand to the desired position. Converging psychophysical and neurophysiological evidence suggests that it accomplishes this via a series of sensorimotor transformations in which the target and the movement are recoded in a series of successive representations of extrinsic and intrinsic space (Soechting and Flanders, 1989). At early stages of planning, the spatial location of the target is remapped from retinotopic into egocentric (eye-, head-, or shoulder-centered) coordinates ({McIn}-tyre et al., 1997; Carrozzo et al., 1999). Vectorial planning hypotheses posit that target information is combined with hand position information (Ghilardi et al., 1995; Vindras et al., 1998) to form a simplified hand-centered plan of the intended movement trajectory as an extent and direction in extrinsic space (Gordon et al., 1994a; Vindras and Viviani, 1998). Movement extent is determined by linearly scaling a stereotyped bell-shaped velocity profile, whereas movement duration is set by task context (Ghez and Krakauer, 2000). Importantly, planning an extent and a direction from the hand requires establishing a scaling factor relating target distance to a peak velocity and hand-centered reference axes relative to an egocentric reference frame. For movements to be accurate in a variety of tasks with different spatial characteristics, both operations must be under adaptive control. For example, when using a computer, if the screen and pad are displaced from in front of the body and the distance of the head from the screen changes, both the reference frame and scaling factor must change to remain accurate with the computer mouse. This paper examines whether, as would be predicted in a vecto-rial framework, errors in extent and direction are processed differently for adaptive learning. To address this question we compared the time course of adaptation and the degree of generalization across work space parameters for two conditions that separately perturbed the scaling and reference axes of the visuomotor transformation. In one condition, systematic extent errors were introduced by changing the gain of the hand path display; in the other, directional biases were introduced by rotating the displayed hand path around the initial position (Cunningham, 1989; Roby-Brami and Burnod, 1995; Pine et al., 1996). The change in display gain required subjects to rescale vector amplitude, whereas the rotation required reorienting vector direction. We focused our analysis on early trajectory variables rather than end points to reduce the contributions of feedback (Gordon et al., 1994a; Messier and Kalaska, 1999) and to separate vectorial parameters from position parameters (Paillard, 1996). The emphasis in all experiments was to determine whether learning achieved for a given target remained local or generalized to other locations in the work space, because patterns of generalization provide insight about the representation of internal models in the nervous system (Imamizu et al. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS} Subjects Fifty-nine right-handed subjects (48 men and 11 women; aged 18-40 years) were in the study. All were naı¨venaı¨ve to the purpose of the experiments, signed an institutionally approved consent form, and were paid to participate. To avoid unwanted crossover effects, we examined separate groups of subjects for adaptation to gain changes and rotation. Separate groups of subjects were also used when comparing the effects of target number on the time course and generalization of learning. In the single-target training experiments (for both gain and rotation), the same six subjects were trained on four separate single targets but only on one of these targets on any given},

Training Purkinje cells with direct stimulation of immediate afferents, the parallel fibers, and pharmacological blocking of interneurons shows that the timing mechanism is intrinsic to the cell itself.

Optogenetically stimulating {ChR}2-expressing Purkinje cells with light steps or trains evoked either asynchronous or synchronous inhibition of {CbN} cells. Steps slowed {CbN} firing. Trains suppressed {CbN} cell firing less effectively, but consistently altered millisecond-scale spike timing. Steps or trains that perturbed stride-related modulation of {CbN} cell firing rates correlated well with irregularities of movement, suggesting that ongoing locomotion is sensitive to alterations in modulated {CbN} cell firing. Unperturbed locomotion continued more often during trains than steps, however, suggesting that stride-related modulation of {CbN} spiking is less readily disrupted by synchronous than asynchronous inhibition.},

	abstract = {1. A detailed theory of cerebellar cortex is proposed whose consequence is that the cerebellum learns to perform motor skills. Two forms of input-output relation are described, both consistent with the cortical theory. One is suitable for learning movements (actions), and the other for learning to maintain posture and balance (maintenance reflexes).2. It is known that the cells of the inferior olive and the cerebellar Purkinje cells have a special one-to-one relationship induced by the climbing fibre input. For learning actions, it is assumed that:(a) each olivary cell responds to a cerebral instruction for an elemental movement. Any action has a defining representation in terms of elemental movements, and this representation has a neural expression as a sequence of firing patterns in the inferior olive; and(b) in the correct state of the nervous system, a Purkinje cell can initiate the elemental movement to which its corresponding olivary cell responds.3. Whenever an olivary cell fires, it sends an impulse (via the climbing fibre input) to its corresponding Purkinje cell. This Purkinje cell is also exposed (via the mossy fibre input) to information about the context in which its olivary cell fired; and it is shown how, during rehearsal of an action, each Purkinje cell can learn to recognize such contexts. Later, when the action has been learnt, occurrence of the context alone is enough to fire the Purkinje cell, which then causes the next elemental movement. The action thus progresses as it did during rehearsal.4. It is shown that an interpretation of cerebellar cortex as a structure which allows each Purkinje cell to learn a number of contexts is consistent both with the distributions of the various types of cell, and with their known excitatory or inhibitory natures. It is demonstrated that the mossy fibre-granule cell arrangement provides the required pattern discrimination capability.5. The following predictions are made.(a) The synapses from parallel fibres to Purkinje cells are facilitated by the conjunction of presynaptic and climbing fibre (or post-synaptic) activity.(b) No other cerebellar synapses are modifiable.(c) Golgi cells are driven by the greater of the inputs from their upper and lower dendritic fields.6. For learning maintenance reflexes, 2(a) and 2(b) are replaced by2'. Each olivary cell is stimulated by one or more receptors, all of whose activities are usually reduced by the results of stimulating the corresponding Purkinje cell.7. It is shown that if (2') is satisfied, the circuit receptor –{\textbackslash}textgreater olivary cell –{\textbackslash}textgreater Purkinje cell –{\textbackslash}textgreater effector may be regarded as a stabilizing reflex circuit which is activated by learned mossy fibre inputs. This type of reflex has been called a learned conditional reflex, and it is shown how such reflexes can solve problems of maintaining posture and balance.8. 5(a), and either (2) or (2') are essential to the theory: 5(b) and 5(c) are not absolutely essential, and parts of the theory could survive the disproof of either.},

	abstract = {In conclusion, recent years have seen renewed interest in the function of the cerebellum, and much progress has been made toward understanding the neuronal coding of sensory and motor events in Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclear and vestibular neurons. Among the important new insights are findings of zonal specificity of Purkinje cell and {CN} neuronal firing, the relevance of population dynamics, including precise spike synchrony and correlated slow rate fluctuations. However, many questions remain to be answered, in particular with respect to the relative contributions of Purkinje and mossy fiber inputs to {CN} spike firing. Neurogenetic tools, which allow cell type-specific manipulations of neuronal activity and synaptic transmission, may now provide the opportunity to address these questions experimentally with unprecedented precision. This symposium review focused implicitly on the sensorimotor aspects of cerebellar coding, but there is increasing evidence for a role of the cerebellum in cognition and emotion (Schmahmann and Caplan, 2006; Koziol et al., 2011; Stoodley, 2011; Fatemi et al., 2012; Heck and Howell, 2013). A comprehensive understanding of the cerebellar neuronal code will ultimately have to include such nonmotor aspects as well. We have just begun to scratch the surface of cerebellar, neuronal encoding mechanisms (Mittleman et al., 2008; Rogers et al., 2011, 2013); hopefully, with the advent of new technologies, the upcoming decades will allow us to unravel them at both sensorimotor levels and beyond.},

	title = {Adaptive Task of Dynamics during Learning of a Motor},
	volume = {14},
	abstract = {We investigated how the {CNS} learns to control movements in different dynamical conditions, and how this learned behavior is represented. In particular, we considered the task of making reaching movements in the presence of externally imposed forces from a mechanical environment. This environment was a force field produced by a robot manipulandum, and the subjects made reaching movements while holding the end-effector of this manipulandum. Since the force field significantly changed the dynamics of the task, subjects' initial movements in the force field were grossly distorted compared to their movements in free space. However, with practice, hand trajectories in the force field converged to a path very similar to that observed in free space. This indicated that for reaching movements, there was a kinematic plan independent of dynamical conditions. The recovery of performance within the changed mechanical environment is motor adaptation. In order to investigate the mechanism underlying this adaptation, we considered the response to the sudden removal of the field after a training phase. The resulting trajectories, named aftereffects, were approximately mirror images of those that were observed when the subjects were initially exposed to the field. This suggested that the motor controller was gradually composing a model of the force field, a model that the nervous system used to predict and compensate for the forces imposed by the environment. In order to explore the structure of the model, we investigated whether adaptation to a force field, as presented in a small region, led to aftereffects in other regions of the workspace. We found that indeed there were aftereffects in workspace regions where no exposure to the field had taken place; that is, there was transfer beyond the boundary of the training data. This observation rules out the hypothesis that the subject's model of the force field was constructed as a narrow association between visited states and experienced forces; that is, adaptation was not via composition of a look-up table. In contrast, subjects modeled the force field by a combination of computational elements whose output was broadly tuned across the motor state space. These elements formed a model that extrapolated to outside the training region in a coordinate system similar to that of the joints and muscles rather than end-point forces. This geometric property suggests that the elements of the adaptive process represent dynamics of a motor task in terms of the intrinsic coordinate system of the sensors and actuators.},

	abstract = {Lesion or degeneration of the cerebellum can profoundly impair adaptive control of reaching in humans. Computational models have proposed that internal models that help control movements form in the cerebellum and influence planned motor output through the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway. However, lesion studies of the cerebellar thalamus have not consistently found impairment in reaching or adaptation of reaching. To elucidate the role of the cerebellar thalamus in humans, we studied a group of essential tremor ({ET}) patients with deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) electrodes placed in the cerebellar thalamus. The stimulation can be turned on or off remotely and is thought to reduce tremor by blocking the spread of the pathological output from the cerebellum. We studied the effect of thalamic {DBS} on the ability to adapt arm movements to novel force fields. Although thalamic {DBS} resulted in a dramatic and significant reduction of tremor in {ET}, it also impaired motor adaptation: the larger the stimulation voltage, the greater the reduction in rates of adaptation. We next examined {ET} patients that had undergone unilateral thalamotomy in the cerebellar thalamus and found that adaptation with the contralateral arm was impaired compared with the ipsilateral arm. Therefore, although both lesion and electrical stimulation of the cerebellar thalamus are highly effective in reducing tremor, they significantly impair the ability of the brain to form internal models of action. Adaptive control of reaching appears to depend on the integrity of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway.},

Visuomotor rotation and force-field tasks impose systematic errors and thereby emphasize adaptation. In skill learning tasks, which for the most part do not involve a perturbation, improved performance is manifest as reduced motor variability and probably depends less on adaptation and more on success-based exploration.

	abstract = {Transformed spatial mappings were used to perturb normal visual-motor processes and reveal the structure of internal spatial representations used by the motor control system. In a 2-D discrete aiming task performed under rotated visual-motor mappings, the pattern of spatial movement error was the same for all Ss: peak error between 90° and 135° of rotation and low error for 180° rotation. A two-component spatial representation, based on oriented bidirectional movement axes plus direction of travel along such axes, is hypothesized. Observed reversals of movement direction under rotations greater than 90° are consistent with the hypothesized structure. Aiming error under reflections, unlike rotations, depended on direction of movement relative to the axis of reflection (see Cunningham \& Pavel, in press). Reaction time and movement time effects were observed, but a speed-accuracy tradeoff was found only for rotations for which the direction-reversal strategy could be used. Finally, adaptation to rotation operates at all target locations equally but does not alter the relative difficulty of different rotations. Structural properties of the representation are invariant under learning. The study of motor performance under transformed spatial mappings goes back at least one hundred years to experiments by Helmholtz (1866/1962) and Stratton (1897a, 1897b) in which prisms were used to invert the visual world. Two important principles emerged from these early studies. Dis-ruption of movement accuracy by optical inversion demon-strated that the mapping between visual and motor represen-tations of space embodies powerful mechanisms not easily overridden by conscious effort. Diminution of the disruption over time demonstrated that the mapping is not fixed, but rather is adaptable or plastic.},

Sensory prediction errors occur when an initial motor command is generated but the predicted sensory consequences do not match the observed values. In some tasks, these sensory errors are monitored and result in on-line corrective motor output as the movement progresses. Here we asked whether cerebellum-dependent adaptation of reaching relies on sensory or on-line motor corrections. Healthy controls and people with hereditary cerebellar ataxia reached during a visuomotor perturbation in two conditions: "shooting" movements without on-line corrections and "pointing" movements that allowed for on-line corrections. Sensory (i.e., visual) errors were available in both conditions. Results showed that the addition of motor corrections did not influence adaptation in control subjects, suggesting that only sensory errors were needed for learning. Cerebellar subjects were comparably impaired in both adaptation conditions relative to controls, despite abnormal and inconsistent on-line motor correction. Specifically, poor on-line motor corrections were unrelated to cerebellar subjects' adaptation deficit (i.e., adaptation did not worsen), further suggesting that only sensory prediction errors influence this process. Therefore adaptation to visuomotor perturbations depends on the cerebellum and is driven by the mismatch between predicted and actual sensory outcome of motor commands.},

Here we studied adaptation of human interlimb coordination using a split-belt treadmill, where the legs can be made to move at different speeds. Human adults, infants, and spinal cats can alter walking patterns on a split-belt treadmill by prolonging stance and shortening swing on the slower limb and vice versa on the faster limb. It is not known whether other locomotor parameters change or if there is a capacity for storage of a new motor pattern after training. We asked whether adults adapt both intra- and interlimb gait parameters during split-belt walking and show aftereffects from training. Healthy subjects were tested walking with belts tied (baseline), then belts split (adaptation), and again tied (postadaptation). Walking parameters that directly relate to the interlimb relationship changed slowly during adaptation and showed robust aftereffects during postadaptation. These changes paralleled subjective impressions of limping versus no limping. In contrast, parameters calculated from an individual leg changed rapidly to accommodate split-belts and showed no aftereffects. These results suggest some independence of neural control of intra- versus interlimb parameters during walking. They also show that the adult nervous system can adapt and store new interlimb patterns after short bouts of training. The differences in intra- versus interlimb control may be related to the varying complexity of the parameters, task demands, and/or the level of neural control necessary for their adaptation.},

Several neural structures, including the spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, and motor cortex, have been implicated in the control of various types of locomotor adaptation. However, it is not known which structures control which types of adaptation and the specific mechanisms by which the appropriate adjustments are made. Here, we used a splitbelt treadmill to test cerebellar contributions to two different forms of locomotor adaptation in humans. We found that cerebellar damage does not impair the ability to make reactive feedback-driven motor adaptations, but significantly disrupts predictive feedforward motor adaptations during splitbelt treadmill locomotion. Our results speak to two important aspects of locomotor control. First, we have demonstrated that different levels of locomotor adaptability are clearly dissociable. Second, the cerebellum seems to play an essential role in predictive but not reactive locomotor adjustments. We postulate that reactive adjustments may instead be predominantly controlled by lower neural centers, such as the spinal cord or brainstem.},

Consolidation is defined as resistance to retrograde interference (interference by task B on initial learning of task A). Consolidation has been demonstrated for simple skills, motor sequencing, and learning of force fields. In contrast, evidence to date suggests that visuomotor learning does not consolidate. We have shown previously that adaptation to a 30 degrees screen-cursor rotation is faster and more complete on relearning 24 hr later. This improvement is prevented if a 30 degrees counter-rotation is learned 5 min after the original rotation. Here, we sought to identify conditions under which rotation learning becomes resistant to interference by a counter-rotation. In experiment 1, we found that interference persists even when the counter-rotation is learned 24 hr after the initial rotation. In experiment 2, we removed potential anterograde interference (interference by task B on relearning of task A) by introducing washout blocks before all of the learning blocks. In contrast to experiment 1, we found resistance to interference (i.e., consolidation) when the counter-rotation was learned after 24 hr but not after 5 min. In experiment 3, we doubled the amount of initial rotation learning and found resistance to interference even after 5 min. Our results suggest that persistent interference is attributable to anterograde effects on memory retrieval. When anterograde effects are removed, rotation learning consolidates both over time and with increased initial training.},

Four different belt speeds (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 m/s) were offered in all possible combinations for the left and right leg. Subjects adapted automatically to a difference in belt speed within 10-20 stride cycles. This adaptation was achieved by a reorganization of the stride cycle with a relative shortening of the duration of the support and lengthening of the swing phase of the "fast" leg and, vice versa, in support and swing duration on the "slow" leg. The electromyogram {EMG} patterns were characterized by two basic observations: (1) onset and timing of {EMG} activity were influenced by biomechanical constraints. A shortening of the support phase on the faster side was related to an earlier onset and increase in gastrocnemius activity, while a coactivation pattern in the antagonistic leg muscles was predominant during a prolonged support phase on the slower side. (2) A differential modulation of the antagonistic leg muscles took place. An increase in ipsilateral belt speed in combination with a constant contralateral belt speed was associated with an almost linear increase in ipsilateral gastrocnemius and contralateral tibialis anterior {EMG} activity, while the contralateral gastrocnemius and ipsilateral tibialis anterior {EMG} activity were little affected. It is concluded that a modifiable timing within the stride cycle takes place with a coupling between ipsilateral support and contralateral swing phase. The neuronal control of this coupling is obviously based on ipsilateral modulation of leg extensor {EMG} by proprioceptive feedback and an appropriate central (e.g. spinal) modulation of contralateral tibialis anterior {EMG} activity.},

	title = {Cerebellar Ataxia: Abnormal Control of Interaction Torques Across Multiple Joints},
	url = {www.physiology.org/journal/jn},
	abstract = {{AND} {CONCLUSIONS} 1. We studied seven subjects with cerebellar lesions and seven control subjects as they made reaching movements in the sagittal plane to a target directly in front of them. Reaches were made under three different conditions: 1) "slow-accurate,' ' 2) "fast-accurate,' ' and 3) "fast as possible." All subjects were videotaped moving in a sagittal plane with markers on the index finger, wrist, elbow, and shoulder. Marker positions were digitized and then used to calculate joint angles. For each of the shoulder, elbow and wrist joints, inverse dynamics equations based on a three-segment limb model were used to estimate the net torque (sum of components) and each of the component torques. The component torques consisted of the torque due to gravity, the dynamic interaction torques induced passively by the movement of the adjacent joint, and the torque produced by the muscles and passive tissue elements (sometimes called ' 'residual' ' torque). 2. A kinematic analysis of the movement trajectory and the change in joint angles showed that the reaches of subjects with cerebellar lesions were abnormal compared with reaches of control subjects. In both the slow-accurate and fast-accurate conditions the cerebellar subjects made abnormally curved wrist paths; the curvature was greater in the slow-accurate condition. During the slow-accurate condition, cerebellar subjects showed target under-shoot and tended to move one joint at a time (decomposition). During the fast-accurate reaches, the cerebellar subjects showed target overshoot. Additionally, in the fast-accurate condition, cere-bellar subjects moved the joints at abnormal rates relative to one another, but the movements were less decomposed. Only three subjects were tested in the fast as possible condition; this condition was analyzed only to determine maximal reaching speeds of subjects with cerebellar lesions. Cerebellar subjects moved more slowly than controls in all three conditions. 3. A kinetic analysis of torques generated at each joint during the slow-accurate reaches and the fast-accurate reaches revealed that subjects with cerebellar lesions produced very different torque profiles compared with control subjects. In the slow-accurate condition , the cerebellar subjects produced abnormal elbow muscle torques that prevented the normal elbow extension early in the reach. In the fast-accurate condition, the cerebellar subjects produced inappropriate levels of shoulder muscle torque and also produced elbow muscle torques that did not vary appropriately with the dynamic interaction torques that occurred at the elbow. Lack of appropriate muscle torque resulted in excessive contributions of the dynamic interaction torque during the fast-accurate reaches. 4. The inability to produce muscle torques that predict, accommodate , and compensate for the dynamic interaction torques appears to be an important cause of the classic kinematic deficits shown by cerebellar subjects during attempted reaching. These kinematic deficits include incoordination of the shoulder and the elbow joints, a curved trajectory, and overshoot. In the fast-accurate condition, cerebellar subjects often made inappropriate muscle torques relative to the dynamic interaction torques. Because of this, interaction torques often determined the pattern of incoordination of the elbow and shoulder that produced the curved trajectory and target overshoot. In the slow-accurate condition, we reason that the cerebellar subjects may use a decomposition strategy so as to simplify the movement and not have to control both joints simultaneously. From these results, we suggest that a major role of the cerebellum is in generating muscle torques at a joint that will predict the interaction torques being generated by other moving joints and compensate for them as they occur.},

The results of psychophysical, functional imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies in normal subjects support this hypothesis. Also, the deficits in patients with cerebellar dysfunction can be attributed to a failure of predictive feed forward control and/or to accurately estimate the consequences of motor commands. Furthermore, the computation performed by the cerebellar-like electrosensory lobes in several groups of fishes is to predict the sensory consequences of motor commands. However, only a few electrophysiological investigations have directly tested whether neurons in the cerebellar cortex have the requisite signals compatible with either an inverse or forward internal model. Our studies in the monkey performing manual pursuit tracking demonstrate that the simple spike discharge of Purkinje cells does not have the dynamics-related signals required to be the output of an inverse dynamics model. However, Purkinje cell firing has several of the characteristics of a forward internal model of the arm. A synthesis of the evidence suggests that the cerebellum is involved in integrating the current state of the motor system with internally generated motor commands to predict the future state.},

	abstract = {The cerebellum plays an essential role in pursuit tracking with the eye and with the hand. During smooth pursuit eye movements, both tracking position and velocity are signaled by Purkinje cells. Purkinje cell simple spike discharge is also modulated by direction and speed during linear manual tracking. This study evaluated how all three parameters, position, movement direction, and speed, are signaled in the simple spike discharge of Purkinje cells during circular manual tracking. Three rhesus monkeys intercepted and then tracked a target moving in a circle in both counterclockwise and clockwise directions across a range of constant target speeds. Two sets of analyses of the simple spike firing of 97 Purkinje cells examined the effects of position, movement direction, and speed. The first approach was the incremental improvement of regression models, initially modeling a pure position dependence, then incorporating movement direction, and finally incorporating speed dependence. The second was a model-independent approach, without any explicit assumptions about the character of the directional tuning or speed effects. Both analyses revealed the same three results: (1) Purkinje cell discharge is spatially tuned, to both the position and direction of movement, and (2) this spatial tuning is not altered by the speed, except (3) the speed scales the average firing and/or depth of modulation. The results suggest that the population of Purkinje cells forms a representation of the entire position-direction space of arm movements, and that the speed modulates the scale of that representation. This speed scaling provides insights into the cerebellar processing of movement-related timing.},

If the cerebellum is the site of an inverse dynamics model, then cerebellar neural activity should signal limb dynamics and be coupled to arm muscle activity. To address this, we recorded from 166 task-related Purkinje cells in two monkeys performing circular manual tracking under varying viscous and elastic loads. Hand forces and arm muscle activity increased with the load, and their spatial tuning differed markedly between the viscous and elastic fields. In contrast, the simple spike firing of 91.0\% of the Purkinje cells was not significantly modulated by the force nor was their spatial tuning affected. For the 15 cells with a significant force effect, changes were small and isolated. These results do not support the hypothesis that Purkinje cells represent the output of an inverse dynamics model of the arm.

	abstract = {Internal models are a key feature of most modern theories of motor control. Yet, it has been challenging to localize internal models in the brain, or to demonstrate that they are more than a metaphor. In the present review, I consider a large body of data on the cerebellar floccular complex, asking whether floccular output has features that would be expected of the output from internal models. I argue that the simple spike firing rates of a single group of floccular Purkinje cells could reflect the output of three different internal models. (1) An eye velocity positive feedback pathway through the floccular complex provides neural inertia for smooth pursuit eye movements, and appears to operate as a model of the inertia of real-world objects. (2) The floccular complex processes and combines input signals so that the dynamics of its average simple spike output are appropriate for the dynamics of the downstream brainstem circuits and eyeball. If we consider the brainstem circuits and eyeball as a more broadly conceived "oculomotor plant," then the output from the floccular complex could be the manifestation of an inverse model of "plant" dynamics. (3) Floccular output reflects an internal model of the physics of the orbit where head and eye motion sum to produce gaze motion. The effects of learning on floccular output suggest that it is modeling the interaction of the visually-guided and vestibular-driven components of eye and gaze motion. Perhaps the insights from studying oculomotor control provide groundwork to guide the analysis of internal models for a wide variety of cerebellar behaviors. © 2009 {IBRO}.},

By adopting such a mode and because cerebellar activity patterns are sensitive to a variety of sensorimotor-related tasks, the cerebellum is believed to support motor and cognitive functions that are encoded in the frontal and parietal lobes of the cerebral cortex. In this model, the cerebellum is hypothesized to make predictions about the consequences of a motor or cognitive command that originates from the cortex to prepare the entire system to cope with ongoing changes. In this framework, cerebellar predictive mechanisms for locomotion are addressed, focusing on sensorial and motoric sequencing.

	abstract = {Processing motor errors is essential for online control of goal-directed movements and motor learning. Evidence from psychophysical and imaging studies supports the long-standing view that error processing is central to cerebellar function. The dominant view is that error-related signals are encoded in the complex spike discharge of Purkinje cells. However, the findings are inconsistent on whether complex spike activity correlates with motor errors. Recently, we examined if simple spike firing carries error signals in monkeys trained to manually track a randomly moving target. The task requires continuous processing of motor errors characterized by the relative movements between the hand-driven cursor and the target center. Linear regression models show that error parameters are robustly represented in the simple spike activity of most Purkinje cells. At the single cell level, the error signals are encoded independently and integrated with kinematic signals. In a large majority of Purkinje cells, correlation strengths between the simple spike discharge and an error parameter have bimodal profiles with respect to time, exhibiting a local maxima corresponding to firing leading the behavior and another one corresponding to firing lagging behavior. The bimodal temporal profiles suggest that individual error parameters are dually encoded as both an internal prediction used for feedback-independent, compensatory movements and the actual sensory feedback used to monitor performance. Approximately 75 \% of the dual representations have opposing modulations of the simple spike activity, one increasing firing and the other depressing firing, as reflected by the reversed signs of the regression coefficients corresponding to the local maxima of the R (2) profile. These dual representations of individual parameters with opposing modulation of the simple spike firing are consistent with the signals needed to generate sensory prediction errors used to update an internal model.},

Therefore, elucidating how motor errors are represented in the cerebellum is essential in understanding cerebellar function, in general, and its role in motor learning, in particular. This review examines how motor errors are encoded in the cerebellar cortex in the context of a forward internal model that generates predictions about the upcoming movement and drives learning and adaptation. In this framework, sensory prediction errors, defined as the discrepancy between the predicted consequences of motor commands and the sensory feedback, are crucial for both on-line movement control and motor learning. While many studies support the dominant view that motor errors are encoded in the complex spike discharge of Purkinje cells, others have failed to relate complex spike activity with errors. Given these limitations, we review recent findings in the monkey showing that complex spike modulation is not necessarily required for motor learning or for simple spike adaptation. Also, new results demonstrate that the simple spike discharge provides continuous error signals that both lead and lag the actual movements in time, suggesting errors are encoded as both an internal prediction of motor commands and the actual sensory feedback. These dual error representations have opposing effects on simple spike discharge, consistent with the signals needed to generate sensory prediction errors used to update a forward internal model.},

These simulations can be used to help understand the computational contributions of various cerebellar components, including the relevance of the enormous number of neurons in the granule cell layer. In previous work we have used a simulation containing 12000 granule cells to develop new predictions and to account for various aspects of eyelid conditioning, a form of motor learning mediated by the cerebellum. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of scaling up this simulation to over one million granule cells using parallel graphics processing unit ({GPU}) technology. We observe that this increase in number of granule cells requires only twice the execution time of the smaller simulation on the {GPU}. We demonstrate that this simulation, like its smaller predecessor, can emulate certain basic features of conditioned eyelid responses, with a slight improvement in performance in one measure. We also use this simulation to examine the generality of the computation properties that we have derived from studying eyelid conditioning. We demonstrate that this scaled up simulation can learn a high level of performance in a classic machine learning task, the cart-pole balancing task. These results suggest that this parallel {GPU} technology can be used to build very large-scale simulations whose connectivity ratios match those of the real cerebellum and that these simulations can be used guide future studies on cerebellar mediated tasks and on machine learning problems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We found that while error direction affected the probability of {CS}, error magnitude altered its temporal distribution. Production of {CS} changed the simple spikes on the next trial, but regardless of the actual visual error, this change biased the movement only along a vector that was parallel to the Purkinje cell's preferred error. From these results, we inferred the anatomy of a sensory-to-motor adaptive controller that transformed visual error vectors into motor-corrections.},

With a headpiece weighing 2.15 g and a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber delivering 920-nm femtosecond laser pulses, the Fhirm-{tPm} is capable of imaging commonly used biosensors ({GFP} and {GcamP}6) at high spatiotemporal resolution (0.64 m laterally and 3.35 m axially, 40 hz at 256 × 256 pixels for raster scanning and 10,000 hz for free-line scanning). We demonstrate the microscope's robustness with hour-long recordings of neuronal activities at the level of spines in mice experiencing vigorous body movements. A goal of neuroscience is to decipher the principles underlying neuronal information processing in freely behaving animals at subcellular, cellular, circuit, and higher levels. In conjunction with fluorescent indicators, light microscopy allows for direct visualization of neuronal activity at spatial and temporal scales spanning orders of magnitude 1 .

Inhibitory Purkinje cells, the only output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, and their postsynaptic target neurons in the cerebellar nuclei, fire action potentials at high, sustained frequencies, suggesting spike rate modulation as a possible code. Yet, millisecond precise spatiotemporal spike activity patterns in Purkinje cells and inferior olivary neurons have also been observed. These results and ongoing studies suggest that the neuronal code used by cerebellar neurons may span a wide time scale from millisecond precision to slow rate modulations, likely depending on the behavioral context.},

	abstract = {This study examined the variability in movement end points in a task in which human subjects reached to targets in different locations on a horizontal surface. The primary purpose was to determine whether patterns in the variable errors would reveal the nature and origin of the coordinate system in which the movements were planned. Six subjects moved a hand-held cursor on a digitizing tablet. Target and cursor positions were displayed on a computer screen, and vision of the hand and arm was blocked. The screen cursor was blanked during movement to prevent visual corrections. The paths of the movements were straight and thus directions were largely specified at the onset of movement. The velocity profiles were bell-shaped, and peak velocities and accelerations were scaled to target distance, implying that movement extent was also programmed in advance of the movement. The spatial distributions of movement end points were elliptical in shape. The major axes of these ellipses were systematically oriented in the direction of hand movement with respect to its initial position. This was true for both fast and slow movements, as well as for pointing movements involving rotations of the wrist joint. Using principal components analysis to compute the axes of these ellipses, we found that the eccentricity of the elliptical dispersions was uniformly greater for small than for large movements: variability along the axis of movement, representing extent variability, increased markedly but nonlinearly with distance. Variability perpendicular to the direction of movement, which results from directional errors, was generally smaller than extent variability, but it increased in proportion to the extent of the movement. Therefore, directional variability, in angular terms, was constant and independent of distance. Because the patterns of variability were similar for both slow and fast movements, as well as for movements involving different joints, we conclude that they result largely from errors in the planning process. We also argue that they cannot be simply explained as consequences of the inertial properties of the limb. Rather they provide evidence for an organizing mechanism that moves the limb along a straight path. We further conclude that reaching movements are planned in a hand-centered coordinate system, with direction and extent of hand movement as the planned parameters. Since the factors which influence directional variability are independent of those that influence extent errors, we propose that these two variables can be separately specified by the brain.},

Here we directly measure synaptic currents using in vivo patch-clamp recordings and confirm that a subset of single granule cells receive convergent functional multimodal (somatosensory, auditory, and visual) inputs via separate mossy fibers. Furthermore, we show that the integration of multimodal signals by granule cells can enhance action potential output.

Silencing strategies vary widely in their mechanism of action and in their spatial and temporal scales. Although such manipulations are commonly applied, the design and interpretation of neuronal silencing experiments present unique challenges, both technically and conceptually. Here, we review the most commonly used tools for silencing neuronal activity and provide an in-depth analysis of their mechanism of action and utility for particular experimental applications. We further discuss the considerations that need to be given to experimental design, analysis, and interpretation of collected data. Finally, we discuss future directions for the development of new silencing approaches in neuroscience. Optogenetic and chemogenetic tools for neuronal silencing have become indispensable in modern neuroscience research.

The richness and complexity of lanthanide optical spectra are reflected in an article published in 1937 by J.H. van Vleck: The Puzzle of Rare Earth Spectra in Solids. After this analytical and exploratory period, lanthanide unique optical properties were taken advantage of in optical glasses, filters, and lasers. In the mid-1970s, E. Soini and I. Hemmilä proposed lanthanide luminescent probes for time-resolved immunoassays (Soini and Hemmilä in Clin Chem 25:353–361, 1979) and this has been the starting point of the present numerous bio-applications based on optical properties of lanthanides. In this chapter, we first briefly outline the principles underlying the simplest models used for describing the electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of trivalent lanthanide ions {LnIII} (4f n ) with special emphasis on luminescence. Since the book is intended for a broad readership within the sciences, we start from scratch defining all quantities used, but we stay at a descriptive level, leaving out detailed mathematical developments.

	abstract = {The cerebellum, a crucial center for motor coordination, is composed of a cortex and several nuclei. The main mode of interaction between these two parts is considered to be formed by the inhibitory control of the nuclei by cortical Purkinje neurons. We now amend this view by showing that inhibitory {GABA}-glycinergic neurons of the cerebellar nuclei ({CN}) project profusely into the cerebellar cortex, where they make synaptic contacts on a {GABAergic} subpopulation of cerebellar Golgi cells. These spontaneously firing Golgi cells are inhibited by optogenetic activation of the inhibitory nucleo-cortical fibers both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that the {CN} may contribute to the functional recruitment of the cerebellar cortex by decreasing Golgi cell inhibition onto granule cells.
          , 
            The cerebellum is a region in the brain that plays a central role in controlling posture and movement. The cerebellum is composed of a cortex and several nuclei. The nuclei are thought to ‘compute’ the signals that are sent from the cerebellum to other parts of the brain to control posture and movement. They do this under the supervision of the cortex. The main interaction between the cortex and the nuclei involves cortical neurons called Purkinje cells inhibiting the activity of the nuclei.
            Ankri, Husson et al. have now used various genetic techniques and mutant mice to identify a new population of neurons in the nuclei of the cerebellum and to express fluorescent markers into these cells. This approach reveals that the axons of these neurons ‘climb’ from the nuclei to the cortex to form a new circuit called the inhibitory nucleo-cortical ({iNC}) pathway. Moreover, activating the {iNC} axons with light reveals that they selectively target and silence a population of neurons called the Golgi cells, which control the transmission of information in the cerebellar cortex.
            Ankri, Husson et al. go on to show that the Golgi cells silenced by the {iNC} pathway differ from other Golgi cells in a number of ways: in particular, these Golgi cells use a chemical called {GABA} to communicate with neurons. The next challenge is to explore how the {iNC} pathway fine-tunes how sensory inputs are processed in the cerebellum, and to better understand its role in the execution of complex movements, including in people with conditions that affect motor function, such as ataxias.},

By recording Purkinje cells in different modules and testing whether their responses rely on recurrent circuits, our results reveal three operational principles about the functional organization of the cerebellum that stand in stark contrast to the conventional view: (1) Antagonistic organization, (2) Recurrent network dynamics, and (3) Intermodular communication.

To gain a better understanding of the computation underlying cerebellar language processing, we developed a biologically constrained cerebellar artificial neural network ({cANN}) model, which implements the recently identified cerebello-cerebellar recurrent pathway. We found that while {cANN} acquires prediction of future words, another function of syntactic recognition emerges in the middle layer of the prediction circuit. The recurrent pathway of the {cANN} was essential for the two language functions, whereas {cANN} variants with further biological constraints preserved these functions. Considering the uniform structure of cerebellar circuitry across all functional domains, the single-circuit computation, which is the common basis of the two language functions, can be generalized to fundamental cerebellar functions of prediction and grammar-like rule extraction from sequences, that underpin a wide range of cerebellar motor and cognitive functions. This is a pioneering study to understand the circuit computation of human-characteristic cognition using biologically-constrained {ANNs}.},

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal properties of the activity of neuronal populations in cortical motor areas have been the subject of many experimental and theoretical investigations, which generated numerous interpretations regarding the mechanisms of preparing and executing limb movements. Two competing models, namely representational and dynamical models, strive to explain the temporal course of neuronal activity and its relationship to different parameters of movements. One proposed dynamical model employs the {jPCA} method, a dimensionality reduction technique, to holistically characterize oscillatory activity in a population of neurons by maximizing rotational dynamics that are present in the data. Different interpretations have been proposed for the rotational dynamics revealed with {jPCA} approach in various brain areas. Yet, the nature of such dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we conducted a comprehensive analysis of several neuronal-population datasets. We found that rotational dynamics were consistently accounted for by a travelling wave pattern. To quantify the rotation strength, we developed a complex-valued measure termed the gyration number. Additionally, we identified the parameters influencing the extent of rotation in the data. Overall, our findings suggest that rotational dynamics and travelling waves are the same phenomena, which requires reevaluation of the previous interpretations where they were considered as separate entities.},

Intriguingly, both visible gait alterations and neuroanatomical abnormalities throughout the brain differ across mutants. We previously used the {LocoMouse} system to quantify specific deficits in locomotor coordination in mildly ataxic Purkinje cell degeneration mice (pcd; Machado et al., 2015). Here, we analyze the locomotor behavior of severely ataxic reeler mutants and compare and contrast it with that of pcd. Despite clearly visible gait differences, direct comparison of locomotor kinematics and linear discriminant analysis reveal a surprisingly similar pattern of impairments in multijoint, interlimb, and whole-body coordination in the two mutants. These findings capture both shared and specific signatures of gait ataxia and provide a quantitative foundation for mapping specific locomotor impairments onto distinct neuropathologies in mice.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The inferior olive is thought to act as an instructor that mentors the Purkinje cells (P-cells) of the cerebellum. As a result, if during a behavior two groups of P-cells received different kinds of information from their olivary inputs, then each group might contribute to different aspects of that behavior. Here, we designed a saccade task in marmosets that dissociated sensory and motor events and then recorded the complex and simple spikes of hundreds of P-cells. We found that the olivary input to one group of P-cells robustly reported the direction of the random visual target, whereas the input to another group principally reported the spatial properties of the forthcoming movement. When a saccade encountered a sensory prediction error, but the subject chose not to make a corrective movement, the error was reported to the first group of P-cells, not the second group. In the first group the simple spikes were suppressed during fixation, then produced a burst before saccade onset that acted primarily as an agonist which accelerated the movement. In the second group the simple spikes were not suppressed during fixation and did not provide an agonist assistance. Rather, the simple spikes acted as an antagonist that decelerated the movement. Therefore, the olive differentiated the P-cells based on whether they would receive primarily sensory or motor information, and this dissociated their contributions to both control of movements and holding still.
          
            Significance statement
            The inferior olive provides more than just error information to the P-cells: it also informs them regarding the spatial properties of forthcoming movements. However, these two kinds of information are sent to two different groups of cells. The P-cells whose olivary input directionally report a visual event have a simple spike response that accelerates the saccade toward that same direction. The P-cells whose olivary input directionally predicts a forthcoming movement have a simple spike response that decelerates the saccade in that same direction.},

	abstract = {Significant experimental, computational, and theoretical work has identified rich structure within the coordinated activity of interconnected neural populations. An emerging challenge now is to uncover the nature of the associated computations, how they are implemented, and what role they play in driving behavior. We term this computation through neural population dynamics. If successful, this framework will reveal general motifs of neural population activity and quantitatively describe how neural population dynamics implement computations necessary for driving goal-directed behavior. Here, we start with a mathematical primer on dynamical systems theory and analytical tools necessary to apply this perspective to experimental data. Next, we highlight some recent discoveries resulting from successful application of dynamical systems. We focus on studies spanning motor control, timing, decision-making, and working memory. Finally, we briefly discuss promising recent lines of investigation and future directions for the computation through neural population dynamics framework.},

	abstract = {Making predictions and validating the predictions against actual sensory information is thought to be one of the most fundamental functions of the nervous system. A growing body of evidence shows that the neural mechanisms controlling behavior, both in motor and non-motor domains, rely on prediction errors, the discrepancy between predicted and actual information. The cerebellum has been viewed as a key component of the motor system providing predictions about upcoming movements and receiving feedback about motor errors. Consequentially, studies of cerebellar function have focused on the motor domain with less consideration for the wider context in which movements are generated. However, motor learning experiments show that cognition makes important contributions to motor adaptation that involves the cerebellum. One of the more successful theoretical frameworks for understanding motor control and cerebellar function is the forward internal model which states that the cerebellum predicts the sensory consequences of the motor commands and is involved in computing sensory prediction errors by comparing the predictions to the sensory feedback. The forward internal model was applied and tested mainly for effector movements, raising the question whether cerebellar encoding of behavior reﬂects task performance measures associated with cognitive involvement. Electrophysiological studies based on pseudorandom tracking in monkeys show that the discharge of Purkinje cell, the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, encodes predictive and feedback signals not only of the effector kinematics but also of task performance. The implications are that the cerebellum implements both effector and task performance forward models and the latter are consistent with the cognitive contributions observed during motor learning. The implications of these ﬁndings include insights into recent psychophysical observations on moving with reduced feedback and motor learning. The ﬁndings also support the cerebellum’s place in hierarchical generative models that work in concert to reﬁne predictions about behavior and the world. Therefore, cerebellar representations bridge motor and non-motor domains and provide a better understanding of cerebellar function within the functional architecture of the brain.},
