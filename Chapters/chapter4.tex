\chapter{Population recordings of cerebellar neurons show a variety of modulations by locomotion}
\label{cha:locopixels}

\section{Abstract}
\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item motivate simultaneous population recordings
    \item a hypothesis about cerebellar funnction during locomotion?
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
\subsection{Cerebellar neurons show a variety of responses to locomotor events}
\subsection{Mossy fibers and Purkinje cells have distinct firing modulations by behavior}
\subsection{Behavior can be decoded from both populations at different delays?}
\subsection{Neural trajectories in neural populations have different complexity in mossy fibers and Purkinje cells}
\subsection{A conceptual hypothesis of cerebellar processing during locomotion}

\section{Discussion}

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Task and experimental design}
\subsection{Neuropixels}
\subsection{Recordings}
\subsection{Histology}
\subsection{Sorting individual units from raw data}
\subsection{Cell type identification}
